<p id="my-love">
my sweet and most prettiest boy <br> 

I dont know where to begin. Maybe from the beginning but I don't know where the beginning even is with us. Well it all started during the day it night I dont really remember when I messaged you. If we are being honest I was scared to get into something with you even if I did like you a little bit. <br> 

<br> Moving on from that we had our complications and thats totally fine. After everything and all that happened I'm glad we came to an agreement that we are made for each other. Permanently. <br> 

<br> I will start with your eyes. They might be brown and boring to some but<br>to me they are the most beautiful brown and boring ever.<br>The way they light up in some way when you smile and the way they make my heart race<br>while you look at me. Your eyes in the sun are the most beautiful too.<br> I love your eyelashes they're so long and curly I am extremely jealous yet grateful they'll be<br> passed on to our kids as well as the rest of you. <br> 

<br>Your lips. You have the softest lips and never have I been kissed <br>so greatly for my first time kissing someone. I love your lips. They can kiss me all day long and even on our wedding day.<br> Your lips are very pretty I think I might be jealous too... <br> 

<br>Next is your beautiful hair. You have such pretty hair. I love pulling my fingers through them and<br>I especially enjoy pulling onto it. Your hair is so pretty when its curly and in the sun.<br> And when its straight and that piece that falls over your face<br> and then you look up, smile and push it back. BUTTERFLIES. MEGA HUGE BUTTERFLIES! <br> 

<br>You're voice. WHERE DO I START!!! I start by how sexy it is when you talk. So freaking hypnotic and just perfect. It gives me butterflies all over my body and makes me smile until my cheeks hurt. I'm so inlove with it agh and when you sing. When you sing softly in that specific tone it just melts my heart and makes me feel so gooey and giggly. <br> 

Your chest. Your chest is probably most greatest to me. I get to lay on your boobies. It's very warm and comfortable and also when we hug I get to hear your heart beat and it's so beautiful too. Very comforting and I love all of it so so much. <br> 

Your stomach. Yes your stomach I am very deeply in love with it. It's so cute qnd squishy and when you go lower theres that sexy v line part and I just really wish yo kiss your pretty tummy. I love your tummy because it's where the butterflies happen when I'm around or whenever you get them :) <br> 

Your hands. WHATS NOT TO LOVE ABOUT YOUR HANDS! FIRSTLY I get to hold them. BEST HAND HOLDRR EVER!!! Next they are good for not only holding hands but holding boobs is well. Very multi purpose if you ask me. They also look very very very sexy especially when on my waist or neck or even wrists. Your hands are also greatly used for head pats, face rests and also playing with my hair or back rubs and booty rubs. <br> 

Your bum. I just am really in love with your bum cheeks. They look like fluffy cute marshmallows covered in chocolate of course. They are so perfect and round and also look extremely warm and inviting. It is very soft and makes a nice pat sound when I hit it and I really like it. It's the best ass I've ever seen and deserves kisses. <br> 

THE WAY THAT YOU SMELL OH MY WORD SENDS ME TO HEAVEN AND BACK IM SO INLOVE WITH YOU ID LOVE YO DROWN IN YOU AND YOUR COLOGNE PLEASE DROWN ME YOU SMELL SO GOOD I LOVE YOU I LOVE JT KISS ME PLEASE YOU CAN MARRY ME PLEASE VERY THANK YOU GOOD SMELLING HANDSOME MAN!!!!!!! <br> 

Next up is smollie. Need I say more??? No. <br> 

I'm not let's talk about what drew me to you fine sir. Definitely not your looks we both know that but you are indeed a fine young specimen. Mine.
It was definitely your charisma and humor. Great sense of humor although sometimes very questionable and sometimes not as funny but very enjoyable. You are indeed charMINE :)
And then there was that smile. That smile that makes my heart flip and stomach twist. The most precious smile ever. That cute smile aghhhh. <br> 

Then theres you. You're all of that. You're the eyes, voice, mouth, bums and all. Everything about you is beautiful and makes me feel very special. You're so perfect theres nothing I cant love about you. Well besides your stupidity but moving on....you are smart. Extremely smart and it's very attractive might I add. Everthing about you is attractive my love. Every little thing about it. <br> 

I'm mesmerized by you. The way you walk, talk, smile, laugh, breathe and everything else you do. Even sleep. You're so beautiful when you sleep. I'd love to rub your cheeks and kiss your face while you sleep. <br>



All of you gives me butterflies, makes me fall inlove with you each and every day even if I dont constantly say it out fully. You're the most perfect there is and I love you most. With all that I can and to the best of my ability. <br> 

I love you more than anything Adnaan Fredericks and I hope thatÂ  together, we can accomplish everything. <br> 

You are my everything. I'm so inlove with all of you. <br> 

I love you <br>
I love you <br>
I love you <br> 

with all the love you can possible think of and with unlimited kisses and hugs <br>
